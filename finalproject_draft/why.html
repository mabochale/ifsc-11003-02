<h1>Why Do People Choose to do Vtubing?</h1>
<p id="intro">When it comes to why, it depends on who you ask, but more often than not, it can be whittled down to 4 different reasons.</p>
<ol>
  <li id="one">Branding</li> <p>Some people might be ok with using their real identity on the internet, but may still choose to use a vtuber model instead because of personal preference.</p>
  <li id="two">Security</li> <p>Meanwhile, on the opposite side of the spectrum, most people use a vtuber model due to wanting to protect their identity online while still basing their brand around an internet persona.</p>
  <li id="three">Expression</li> <p>Most people use Vtubing as a fun means of self expression, which means that people can use Vtubing to help bolster one's creativity.</p>
  <li id="four">Confidence</li> <p>As it would suggest, people use Vtubing as a means of helping improve one's confidence, which can have many positive effects.</p>
