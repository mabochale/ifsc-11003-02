<h2>What Is Vtubing?</h2>
<p>VTubing, short for Virtual YouTubing, is a form of online content creation where individuals use digital avatars, often animated and designed in a stylized manner, to interact with their audience. These avatars are typically created using 2D or 3D modeling software and are controlled in real-time through motion capture technology, allowing the VTuber to mimic their movements and expressions.</p>
<p>There are two methods of Vtubing, one of those methods is to use a static image of your character, one with the character being static and another image of the character talking. This method is commonly referred to as "PNGTubing." The second method involves using live 2D or 3D models that are rigged and animated in real-time, providing a more dynamic and interactive experience for both the VTuber and their audience. most people start off with PNGTubing because, compared to a 3d avatar, it is much easier to create and requires less technical skill, and is therefore more affordable.</p>
